                <h3>It's the little things in life &#9825;</h3>
                <p><br>Details, details, details! The little things in life matter most, 
                    and our hope is that our cute journals add a little sunshine to your day. 
                    Whether you are using our journals for school, poetry, a little self-care journaling, or for 
                    organizing your thoughts, we're here for you! Like the little flowers
                    that grow between the cracks in the sidewalk, we exsist as a reminder that there is
                    beauty in the mundane. In case no one told you today, we love you!
                    <br>
                    <br>Xoxo,
                    <br>Our Team

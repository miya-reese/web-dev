            <h3>It's the little things in life &#9825;</h3>
            <p>Details, details, details! The little things in life matter most, 
                and our hope is that our cute journals add a little sunshine to your day. 
                Whether you are using our journals for school, poetry, a little self-care journaling, or for 
                organizing your thoughts, we're here for you! Like the little flowers
                that grow between the cracks in the sidewalk, we exsist as a reminder that there is
                beauty in the mundane. In case no one told you today, we love you!</p>
            <p>Xoxo, <br>Our Team</p>
